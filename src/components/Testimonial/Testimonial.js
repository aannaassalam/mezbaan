                            staff. Their rolls are actually the best I've ever
                            tasted in this city, they are truly Kolkata rolls.
                            Kudos to them and hope they keep up the quality.

                            Best kolkata style Briyani in Baroda. It is really
                            good, portion is also good. Just love it‚ù§ Bengalis
                            in Baroda should give it a try. They do have chicken
                            rolls and all which is also nice but Briyani is
                            great.

                            had unique flavour. Highly recommended for a visit

                            the rolls are the most delicious dishes.
